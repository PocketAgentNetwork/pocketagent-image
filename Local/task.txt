CURRENT TASK - Local PocketAgent Image v1
==========================================

GOAL: Get OpenClaw running under PocketAgent branding on Mac

SCOPE: Just OpenClaw for now, branded as PocketAgent
- Install OpenClaw
- Wrap it in PocketAgent branding
- Make it run as "PocketAgent" service
- User never sees "OpenClaw" anywhere

---

WHAT WE'RE BUILDING:
====================

A folder structure that:
1. Contains OpenClaw (hidden inside)
2. Runs as "PocketAgent" 
3. All branding is PocketAgent
4. User interacts with "PocketAgent", not "OpenClaw"

---

STEPS:
======

1. CREATE FOLDER STRUCTURE
   /Applications/PocketAgent/
   ├── bin/                    # PocketAgent executables
   │   └── pocketagent        # Main startup script
   ├── lib/
   │   └── openclaw/          # OpenClaw installation (cloned & built)
   ├── home/                  # Agent's home directory (like /home/node in cloud)
   │   ├── .openclaw/        # OpenClaw config dir
   │   │   ├── memory/       # Agent memory
   │   │   ├── openclaw.json # OpenClaw configuration
   │   │   └── credentials/  # API keys, tokens
   │   ├── files/            # Workspace (agent's working files)
   │   ├── .local/
   │   │   └── bin/          # Tools agent installs
   │   ├── .ssh/             # SSH keys
   │   └── .config/          # Other configs
   ├── data/                  # PocketAgent-managed data
   │   ├── pocketmodel/       # PocketModel data (later)
   │   └── pan/               # PAN network data (later)
   └── logs/                  # All logs
       ├── openclaw.log
       └── pocketagent.log

2. INSTALL OPENCLAW
   - Clone OpenClaw repo into lib/openclaw/
   - Install dependencies (Node 22+, pnpm)
   - Build OpenClaw (pnpm build)
   - Set HOME=/Applications/PocketAgent/home when running
   - OpenClaw will automatically use:
     * Config: $HOME/.openclaw/
     * Workspace: $HOME/files/
   - Test it runs

3. CREATE POCKETAGENT WRAPPER
   - bin/pocketagent script that:
     * Sets HOME=/Applications/PocketAgent/home
     * Starts OpenClaw from lib/openclaw/
     * Branded startup messages
     * All logs say "PocketAgent" not "OpenClaw"

4. CREATE STARTUP SCRIPT
   - Script to start PocketAgent on Mac
   - Could be launchd daemon later
   - For now, just a simple start script

5. TEST
   - Run ./bin/pocketagent
   - Should start OpenClaw under the hood
   - Access web dashboard
   - Send message, get response
   - Everything branded as PocketAgent

---

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
=================
✅ OpenClaw installed in /Applications/PocketAgent/lib/openclaw/
✅ Home dir at /Applications/PocketAgent/home/ (contains .openclaw, files, etc.)
✅ Can run: pocketagent start
✅ Agent responds to messages
✅ User only sees "PocketAgent" branding
✅ OpenClaw is completely hidden

---

STORAGE NOTES (matches cloud setup):
=====================================
We set HOME=/Applications/PocketAgent/home when running OpenClaw.
OpenClaw then automatically uses:
- $HOME/.openclaw/ → config, memory, credentials
- $HOME/files/ → workspace (agent's working files)
- $HOME/.local/bin/ → tools agent installs
- $HOME/.ssh/ → SSH keys
- $HOME/.config/ → other configs

This matches the proven cloud Docker setup exactly!

---

LATER (NOT NOW):
================
- PocketModel integration
- PAN Supervisor
- Client [Web, Mobile, Desktop]
- QR pairing
- Installer packaging

---

FOCUS: Just get OpenClaw running as "PocketAgent" first.
