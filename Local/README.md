# 📟 PocketAgent Local Deployment

Native installation of PocketAgent on your local machine (Mac, Linux, Windows).

---

## 🎯 What This Is

Install PocketAgent as a **background service** on your local machine. Your personal AI agent runs 24/7, accessible via:
- Web UI (http://localhost:18789) - available now
- Native Client apps - coming soon (mobile & desktop)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Coming Soon!** One-line installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.pocketagent.com | bash
```

The installer will:
1. Ask you to personalize your agent (your name, agent name, timezone, language)
2. Install PocketAgent as a background service
3. Start your agent automatically
4. Give you a gateway token for client apps

## ⭐ Personalization Feature

The installer asks you:
- **Your name** → Agent knows who it's serving
- **Agent name** → Call it whatever you want (Jarvis, Alfred, etc.)
- **Timezone** → For scheduling and time-aware tasks
- **Language** → Preferred language

Every installation is unique and personal!

See [PERSONALIZATION.md](./PERSONALIZATION.md) for details.

## 🎮 Usage

After installation:

```bash
# Check status
pocketagent status

# Start agent
pocketagent start

# Stop agent
pocketagent stop

# Update to latest OpenClaw
pocketagent update

# View logs
pocketagent logs
```

**Access web UI:**
```
http://localhost:18789
```

---

## 🔄 Updating

When OpenClaw releases updates:

```bash
pocketagent update
```

This will:
1. Stop your agent
2. Backup current version
3. Download latest OpenClaw
4. Rebuild everything
5. Restart your agent

**Your data is safe!** All settings, memory, and workspace files are preserved.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Installer runs** → Sets up folders, installs OpenClaw, personalizes workspace
2. **Agent starts** → Runs as background service (launchd/systemd)
3. **Gateway opens** → Listens on localhost:18789
4. **You connect** → Via web browser (now) or client app (later)
5. **Agent works** → 24/7 personal AI operator

---

## 📱 Client Apps (Coming Soon)

**Desktop Client:**
- Native app for Mac/Windows/Linux
- Connect to your local agent
- Better UX than web browser

**Mobile Client:**
- iOS & Android apps
- Connect via gateway token or QR code
- Control your agent from anywhere (on same network)
