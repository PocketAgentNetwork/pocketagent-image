POCKETAGENT WORKSPACE STRUCTURE
================================

The workspace is where the agent lives and operates.
It contains the main agent's identity, sub-agents, and skills.

MAIN AGENT FILES (workspace root):
===================================

1. IDENTITY.md (SAME FOR ALL POCKETAGENTS)
   - "I am a PocketAgent"
   - Type: AI Agent
   - Name & Emoji (user fills during onboarding)
   - This is universal - all PocketAgents share this base

2. SOUL.md (SAME FOR ALL POCKETAGENTS)
   - Core PocketAgent personality
   - Values and philosophy
   - Behavioral guidelines
   - Tone and style
   - "Who you are, not what you do"
   - This is universal - defines what it means to be a PocketAgent

3. USER.md (USER-SPECIFIC)
   - User information
   - User preferences
   - Context about who the agent serves
   - Set during onboarding

4. JOB.md (USER-DEFINED - THE KEY DIFFERENTIATOR!)
   - What this PocketAgent does
   - Role/occupation (personal assistant, developer, researcher, CFO, etc.)
   - Responsibilities
   - Specialized knowledge for this job
   - How to approach tasks for this role
   
   ANALOGY: All humans are humans (IDENTITY + SOUL), but each has a different job.
   - Same species, different occupation
   - Same PocketAgent, different role
   
   Examples:
   - Personal Assistant: "Manage calendar, emails, reminders, daily briefings"
   - Developer: "Write code, debug, review PRs, manage deployments"
   - Research Agent: "Deep research, summarize papers, track trends"
   - Social Media Manager: "Post content, engage, track metrics"
   - CFO: "Monitor finances, track spending, investment advice"

5. AGENTS.md
   - Operating instructions for the agent
   - How to use memory
   - What files to read on startup
   - Capabilities and rules
   - Loaded at the start of every session

6. MEMORY.md
   - Long-term curated memory
   - Important context that persists
   - User preferences learned over time
   - Things to remember

7. HEARTBEAT.md
   - Periodic tasks
   - Scheduled checks
   - Recurring actions
   - Keep it short to avoid token burn

8. TOOLS.md
   - Notes about local tools and conventions
   - Does NOT control tool availability (only guidance)
   - Environment information

9. BOOT.md
   - Optional startup checklist
   - Executed on gateway restart
   - Keep it short

10. BOOTSTRAP.md
    - One-time first-run ritual
    - Setup instructions for new workspace
    - Delete after completing setup

11. memory/ folder
    - Daily memory logs (one file per day)
    - Format: YYYY-MM-DD.md
    - Agent reads today + yesterday on session start
    - Automatic short-term memory

---

SUB-AGENTS (workspace/agents/):
================================

Each sub-agent has its own folder with:
- IDENTITY.md (who they are)
- SOUL.md (their personality)
- AGENTS.md (their capabilities & tools)

Example:
workspace/agents/research-agent/
├── IDENTITY.md
├── SOUL.md
└── AGENTS.md

Sub-agents are spawned by the main agent when needed.
They have specialized roles and personalities.

---

SKILLS (workspace/skills/):
===========================

Each skill has its own folder with:
- SKILL.md (what it does, how to use it)
- Optional: HEARTBEAT.md (periodic checks)
- Optional: MESSAGING.md (communication guide)
- Optional: code/config files

Example:
workspace/skills/web-search/
├── SKILL.md
└── (optional other files)

Skills are tools/capabilities the agent can use.
They extend what the agent can do.

---

THE POCKETAGENT PHILOSOPHY:
===========================

ONE AGENT, INFINITE JOBS

All PocketAgents are the same "species" (IDENTITY + SOUL).
What makes each unique is their JOB (user-defined role).

Like humans:
- Born human (IDENTITY)
- Human nature (SOUL)
- Choose occupation (JOB)

This means:
- No need for "types" of agents
- User defines what their agent does
- Same core, different specialization
- Flexible and customizable

FOR POCKETAGENT IMAGE:
======================

We need to design:
1. Universal IDENTITY.md (all PocketAgents)
2. Universal SOUL.md (all PocketAgents)
3. Template JOB.md (user customizes during onboarding)
4. Default skills (if any)
5. Default sub-agents (if any)

The JOB.md is what makes each PocketAgent unique!

---

SEEDING STRATEGY:
=================

When PocketAgent Image is built:
1. Copy complete workspace structure with all files
2. Seed with universal IDENTITY.md (all PocketAgents)
3. Seed with universal SOUL.md (all PocketAgents)
4. Include template JOB.md (user fills during onboarding)
5. Include template USER.md (user fills during onboarding)
6. Include AGENTS.md (operating instructions)
7. Include empty MEMORY.md (agent fills over time)
8. Include empty HEARTBEAT.md (user adds tasks as needed)
9. Include template TOOLS.md (user fills with environment info)
10. Include empty BOOT.md (user adds startup tasks if needed)
11. Include BOOTSTRAP.md (first-run setup guide)
12. Create memory/ folder (agent creates daily logs automatically)
13. Create agents/ folder (for future sub-agents)
14. Create skills/ folder (for installable skills)

During user onboarding:
1. User fills IDENTITY.md (name & emoji)
2. User fills USER.md (who they are)
3. User defines JOB.md (what they want agent to do)
4. User optionally fills TOOLS.md (local environment)
5. Agent reads BOOTSTRAP.md for setup instructions
6. User deletes BOOTSTRAP.md after setup complete
7. Agent becomes specialized for that role

User can later:
- Change JOB.md (reassign agent to new role)
- Add tasks to HEARTBEAT.md
- Add startup tasks to BOOT.md
- Install skills in skills/ folder
- Spawn sub-agents in agents/ folder
- Customize further
